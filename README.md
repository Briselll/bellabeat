ANALYSIS 

In order to answer the question of how consumers are using their smart devices to provide feedback to Bellabeat marketers, I began with looking for good data.
This was a lengthy process as I had to find a dataset that connected device usage to marketing. I was able to locate one in Kaggle called : Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products
which I favored because it gave real life information and a large amount of it which helped with bias. I began by cleaning the data, removing empty blanks and any duplicates. 
Additionally, I removed rows that would not service answering the ultimate question. After successfully cleaning the data, I began to form questions with the data that I had, 
the first being the most sold item in the dataset, I found this by creating a correlating graph for the most reviews device. I found that the most reviewed, and therefore hypothetically 
speaking the most purchased, was the magenta fire tablet 7 display wfi 8GB Magenta. My recommendation based on this would be for bellabeat to experiment with its device colors 
and people seemed to prefer this over the color black. My second curiosity was the correlation between ratings and word count. I wanted to see if reading the reviews would prove
helpful in finding holes in the devices. I found that the less people liked the product, the less they had to say. My recommendation to Bellabeat based on this would be to focus
on the positive response from users as building guide verses negative responses as they may not be very substantial.
